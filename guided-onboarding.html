  <h3>What this step is doing</h3>

  <p>
    We are using an AI model to run a guided imagination process that helps a creator design their
    potential community before any infrastructure exists.
    Through a structured series of prompts, the system proposes positioning, naming,
    domain strategy, focus line, and host identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each approval locks a decision and writes structured fields into a <b>Community Blueprint</b>.
    In parallel, the full conversation transcript is stored as a training signal so the model can
    improve future runs without adding friction to the creator experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is the complete, human-readable Blueprint shown below.
    At this point the creator can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Proceed to setup</b> → choose a plan and trigger provisioning using this Blueprint</li>
    <li><b>Pause</b> → the Blueprint is saved and they can return later</li>
    <li><b>Refine</b> → go back into the ideation flow and change decisions</li>
  </ul>

    <b>Community name</b>

    <b>Domain path</b>
    <div>ukrainebrief.commonshub.social</div>

    <b>Short description</b>
    <div>
      A real-time strategic briefing room for analysts and engaged readers
      tracking how the Ukraine war is reshaping the global balance of power.
    </div>

    <b>Focus line</b>
    <div>Real-time analysis of the Ukraine war</div>

    <b>Owner handle</b>
    <div>@phillipspobrien@ukrainebrief.commonshub.social</div>

    <b>Owner bio</b>
    <div>
      I am Professor of Strategic Studies at the University of St Andrews and
      author of a leading analysis of the war in Ukraine and modern military
      power. I use this space to provide real-time context, test ideas, and
      work in the open with serious participants. This is the live briefing
      room for that effort.
    </div>

    <b>Long description</b>
    <div>
      This is the live signal space for following how the war in Ukraine is
      transforming modern warfare and the structure of global power. It exists
      to provide continuous strategic context that sits between formal analysis
      and the speed of daily events, creating a durable record that can be
      worked on in real time.<br/><br/>

      It is for analysts, journalists, policy professionals, military observers,
      and highly engaged readers who are already serious about the subject and
      want a place where informed discussion and source-driven interpretation
      can compound over time. Casual commentary is not the purpose; this is a
      working room for people who track developments closely and think in
      strategic terms.<br/><br/>

      Here you will find rapid assessments of battlefield dynamics, debates
      about military effectiveness, historical comparison, and collaborative
      interpretation that outlives the news cycle. Threads become reference
      points. Disagreements are part of the analytical process. The goal is to
      build shared context as events unfold.<br/><br/>

      This space is independent and not shaped by algorithms or platform
      incentives. The signal is chronological, the participants are visible,
      and the conversation cannot be throttled when it becomes most important.<br/><br/>

      I host this as an extension of my ongoing work on war and strategy, to
      test arguments in the open, learn from informed participants, and
      maintain a continuous strategic briefing that anyone serious about the
      subject can rely on.
